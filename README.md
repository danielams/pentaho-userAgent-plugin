# Acknowledgments #
Thanks Harald Walker that made freely available the user-agent-utils, on his [blog](http://www.bitwalker.eu/blog), and in the [GIT](https://github.com/HaraldWalker/user-agent-utils) the code that we are used to parse the user agent strings. It was held all the original class packages.
